The countries each send their entry, and based on the live performance they receive votes from the audience and the judges to determine their scores. The condition is that people aren't allowed to vote for their own countries. There was a hypothesis that people tend to vote for their neighboring countries. In this notebook, I wish to analyze if this is indeed true.
